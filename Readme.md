Polyvalent Extensible Library for Image Computing and ANalysis is a multi-platform framework, written in Java, dedicated to Image Processing. The project started at the Universit√© de Strasbourg in 2005 but its contributors are no longer in this university. It allows the processing of image from different types (2D, video, 3D, 3D+t) and origins (casual, medical, astronomic, remote sensing, ...) and contains many standard image processing algorithms.
